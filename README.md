This is the first game I made after starting Computer Science. It uses graphics to show an image of a pet that looks like a smiley face, and you can feed it food and water, wash it, play with it, and let it sleep. There are buttons on the bottom right hand side for each action and a quit button as well. There are also bars that indicate the pet's status. When a bar hits the bottom, the pet dies and the game ends.
